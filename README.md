# Medical Document Analyzer

A Next.js application that uses Google's Gemini AI to extract patient information directly from PDF documents. The application can identify patient names and dates of birth from medical documents, even when the information appears in random locations within the PDF.
âœ¨ Handwritten text in scanned PDFs is supported.

## Features

- ðŸ“„ PDF file upload with drag-and-drop support
- ðŸ¤– AI-powered direct PDF analysis using Gemini
- ðŸŽ¯ Automatic patient name and date of birth detection
- ðŸ“± Responsive, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- âš¡ Real-time processing and results display
- ðŸ”’ Secure file handling

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

## Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   # Gemini API Key
   # Get your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
